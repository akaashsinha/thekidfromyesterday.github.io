<h2>Ways to reduce institutional racism</h2>
    <h3>While not a complete list by any means these are many ways to reduce racism</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <ol id="list">
        <li>Have tough conversations with yourself and your community on race</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Having these conversations will not only broaden your perspective but as well as others</li>
            <li>Condemning racist speech makes it clear to the other person that it is not cool</li>
            <li>Without this foundation all the other steps are futile</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Create an awareness of the issues that the African-American community face</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Many people are unaware of the struggles face that African Americans in institutional racism</li>
            <li>When people realize that these problems are not OK, more people will work to fix them</li>
            <li>Using social media can create an awareness that other generations could have only dreamed of</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Converting the awareness into action</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once people have become aware of the issues, you have to first organize all of those people before any action is possible</li>
            <li>Once people are organized they can more effectively put pressure on their elected officials to change their positions on issues that disproportionally hurt African Americans</li>
            <li>If no one is willing to change their position then the people must take matters into their own hands and run for office themselves</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
